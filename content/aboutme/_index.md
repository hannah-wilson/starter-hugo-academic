I'm originally from Bloomington, Indiana and a proud Hoosier. Before coming to Vanderbilt, I earned my PhD in Political Science at Notre Dame and  BA in Political Science and French at IU Bloomington. 

Outside of work, I enjoy middle & long distance running (<10k), reading, and playing with my tabby cat, Henri. My guilty pleasure is bad country music, so I feel very fortunate to be working in Nashville. The most important person in my life is my twin sister, Eileen. She currently lives in Washington, D.C. where she does not work in or study politics.
