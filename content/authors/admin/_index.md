Welcome! My name is Hannah and I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <a href = "https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/"> Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions </a> at Vanderbilt University. I earned my PhD in Political Science from the <a href = "http://politicalscience.nd.edu"> 
University of Notre Dame </a> in 2022. I work primarily on legislative and state-level politics with a secondary focus on quantitative methodology. My broader research agenda concerns political networks, institutional mediators of elite behavior, and modeling dependent data -- for example, behavioral diffusion, multilevel networks, and visualization. I am originally from Bloomington, Indiana and graduated with honors from <a href = "http://polisci.indiana.edu">Indiana University Bloomington </a> in 2016 with a B.A. in Political Science and French.

I've presented my work at conferences around the U.S. and internationally. Most recently, I taught an independent course on <a href = "https://www.hannah-wilson.com/files/syllabus.pdf/"> American state politics </a> during spring 2020. I've also led a variety of introductory classes on American politics, Comparative politics, and International relations and previously served as the teaching assistant for the graduate-level quantitative methods sequences in the <a href = "http://politicalscience.nd.edu"> Department of Political Science</a> and <a href="http://keough.nd.edu">Keough School of Global Affairs</a>. You can find my published research in the peer-reviewed journal {{% staticref "files/paper.pdf" %}} *Political Analysis*{{% /staticref %}}.
